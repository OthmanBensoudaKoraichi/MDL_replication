Another notable feature of the litigation was that both plaintiff and defense counsel urged the MDL judge to create a larger leadership structure, particularly for the discovery involved in automotive cases. Defense attorneys observed that experienced lawyers in such cases were valuable to work with. Judge Seylna ultimately allowed the plaintiffs to enlarge the size of leadership.

The initial case management order sets up a mandatory mediation protocol which appears to have been used to resolve all the claims. After that, all the orders are skirmishes over common benefit fees, particularly the extent to which state court plaintiffs have to kick in to pay the MDL leaders' fees. It ends with a September 2018 order awarding about $2M, mainly to Seeger Weiss and Waters & Kraus 

--ASZ Note: It might be helpful to compare the Zimmer litigation structure to other hip implant cases, including Striker and Dupuy. Striker was resolved very similarly. So, it would be helpful to know if we're seeing the same structure proposed by the same kinds of plaintiff attorneys.

DN 2/25: Confirmed that no leadership orders entered after Doc No. 9. Lots of orders reducing common benefit fees at the end of the litigaiton.
